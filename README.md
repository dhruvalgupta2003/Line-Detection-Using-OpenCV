# Line-Detection-Using-OpenCV

# 1. Convert the image to grayscale

# 2. Reduce noise using Gaussian Blur

# 3. Fine Lane lines using canny function

# 4. Find Region of interest

# 5. Merge it with Canny image using Bitwise and operator to each pixel

# 6. Use Hough Transform to find the best fit line

# 7. Optimize the lines using average slope and intercept 

# 8. Repaeat the same steps for the video
