# Line-Detection-Using-OpenCV


# 1. Load the image

# 4. Find Region of interest

# 5. Merge it with Canny image using Bitwise and operator to each pixel

# 6. Use Hough Transform to find the best fit line

# 7. Optimize the lines using average slope and intercept 

# 8. Repaeat the same steps for the video
